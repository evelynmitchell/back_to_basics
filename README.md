# Introduction

I've been working on the testing and ghactions for a Machine Learning assembly kit/wrapper called [zetascale](https://github.com/kyegomez/zeta)

As part of this, I need to get a better understanding of how to use this framework, in order to test it.

## Background

## Contribution

This repository will contain some simple examples of how to use the framework, and how to test it.

The examples will be first in the area of Natural Language Processing(NLP) as these models can take less time to train, and have several distinct use cases with good benchmarks.

## Stack

I'll be using the following stack:

- google colab - for training and testing (GPUs)
- python 3.10
- pytorch
- transformers, statespace models, and other models
- huggingface for data and benchmarks
- zetascale for training and testing
